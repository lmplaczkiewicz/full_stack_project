Unsolved Problems:
The next project I want to get a full handle on validation of form fields and to design a better opening screen for the user.

I was also having issues having multiple error message show up in the center of the screen using bootstrap alerts. I want to invest more time into understanding that to make it more user friendly.

Development Progress:
Thurs - Fri
I began the project by setting up my main resource, locations, in the back-end and then started on the front-end. I began by doing a bare html page with several buttons linked to modals to test my user and location resource. Once all the CRUD actions were working I linked the tables and re-tested the resources. Once CRUD was working I began pushing forward with styling.

Sat - Sun
Styling was the main item I worked on over the weekend with some bug fixes related to CRUD.

Mon - Tues
I changed up some display messages. Changed some column names. Added in a company table resource and the CRUD actions in relation to that additional table. I changed the styling to fit two table displays and added in bootstrap alerts for error/success messages. I worked through a few final bugs and some form updates and deployed the last iteration to production.
